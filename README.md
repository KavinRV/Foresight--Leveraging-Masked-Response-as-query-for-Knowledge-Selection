# Foresight: Leveraging Masked Response as query for Knowledge Selection
 Recent works in knowledge intensive NLP tasks have demon- strated that the integration of re-ranker components as a  pivotal technique for enhancing performance, especially for conversation based tasks. Building upon this trajectory of  research, we present "ForeSight," a specialized re-ranker tai- lored for dialogue systems. ForeSight employs a novel ap- proach by utilizing a masked response as the query for re- ranking. The re-ranker model is optimized through a process  of self-distillation, utilizing keyword estimation likelihood objective as teacher for the primary ranking objective. To evaluate the efficacy of ForeSight, we conduct experiments on a knowledge-grounded conversation dataset known as  Wizard of Wikipedia. Our findings exhibit a notable improve- ment in re-ranking performance when employing a masked  response as opposed to using only the last utterance.
